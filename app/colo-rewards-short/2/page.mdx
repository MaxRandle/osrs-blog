## New Sunfire splinters sink

**Suggestion: Sunfire Bolts**

<Row>

<NoShrink>![bolts](/media/sunfire-bolts.png)</NoShrink>

Chance on hit to activate special effect **Sunflare cinders** which inflicts the target with a powerful burn over 40 ticks (24 seconds).

</Row>

<Row>

The Zaryte Crossbow extends the burn duration to 44 ticks.

</Row>

**Ruby bolt comparison:**

The Ruby bolts (e) special effect activates independently of your accuracy roll. The Sunfire bolt special effect activates only on a successful hit.

Ruby bolts (e) are better on high defence targets, Sunfire bolts overtake with end-game gear and/or against low defence targets.
