## Intro

The Colosseum is some of the best content in OSRS.

Sadly, excluding the 1kc Quiver, the uniques are far too niche early wave splinter bots ravaged the profitability. The rewards are not in-line with the difficulty of the content.

My goal is to push colosseum reward changes into the community sphere of discussion by showcasing some creativity, not to get these proposals added to the game as is.

**Disclaimer:** My post contains critical opinions, suggestions are conceptual, not balanced, and imperfect. No part of this post is AI generated. No I'm not hoarding splinters.
