## Intro

The Colosseum is some of the best content in OSRS.

Sadly, excluding the 1kc Quiver, the uniques are far too niche and early wave splinter bots destroyed player profits. The rewards are not in-line with the difficulty of the content.

My goal is to push Colosseum reward changes into the community sphere of discussion by showcasing some creativity, not to get these proposals added to the game as is.

**Disclaimer:** Suggestions are conceptual, not balanced, and imperfect. No part of this post is AI generated. No I'm not hoarding splinters.
