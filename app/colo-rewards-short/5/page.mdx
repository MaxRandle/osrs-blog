## Sunfire splinter economy health

**Additional item sinks**

<Row>

A new end game fire-weak boss would be an effective splinter sink thanks to Sunfire runes.

**Botting mitigation**

Early wave botting heavily erodes player profits from participating in the Colosseum.

</Row>

The quantity of splinters awarded from Colosseum waves 1 - 4 needs to be reduced. This would force bots to risk more valuable gear in order to clear wave 5 or 6 and beyond.

Encounters that can be farmed with extreme budget gear are the most over-botted areas in the game.

The more time and capital that bots have to risk to get the same reward as a player, the fewer bots there will be (assuming that bots actually get banned regularly of course).

**The end**

Thanks for reading my post and remember to use the North-West pillar.
