# Colosseum rewards revived

## Problem

The reward structure designed to sustain the Colosseum long term has
collapsed due to obsolete uniques. Beyond the 1 kc Quiver, the current
set of Colosseum unique rewards have been disappointing since the day
they were proposed, niche at best and irrelevant at worst.

- The rewards are simply not in-line with the difficulty of the content.
- The price of splinters is abysmal. Over-abundant and lacking a primary item sink.
- Terrible gp/hour for mains. Functionally useless uniques for irons to go for.

## Solution

I want to suggest potential new uses and designs for the colosseum
rewards to hopefully revive the reward space for this incredible
content.

**Disclaimer:** My suggestions are conceptual, not balanced, and certainly not perfect. DPS comparisons are based on rough napkin calculations.
