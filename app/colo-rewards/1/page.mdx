## Intro

The Colosseum is some of the best content in OSRS. The replayability, varied gameplay, mechanics, and final boss make this content fun, challenging, engaging, and satisfying.

While this post includes critical opinions, it comes from a place of genuine admiration for the content. It's my favourite thing to do in the game and I have hundreds of completions.

Sadly, the reward structure designed to sustain the Colosseum long term has collapsed due to underpowered uniques and early wave splinter bots.

The Colosseum rewards have so much potential and I would love to see them revisited by Jagex to give players have more incentive to return after the 1kc Quiver.

## Problem

- The rewards are not in-line with the difficulty of the content.
- Splinters are over-abundant and lacking a primary item sink.
- Uncompetitive gp/hour for mains.
- Disappointing uniques for irons to grind.

## Solution

I want to suggest potential new uses and designs for the colosseum rewards to hopefully revive the reward space for this incredible content.

**Disclaimer:** My suggestions are opinionated and conceptual, not balanced, and certainly not perfect. The goal of this post is not to get these changes added to the game as is, I simply want to push colosseum reward changes into the sphere of discussion by showcasing some creativity. DPS comparisons are based on rough napkin maths. No part of this post is AI generated.
