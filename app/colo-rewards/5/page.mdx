## Sunfire splinter economy health

**Additional item sinks**

<Row>

Sunfire runes have the potential to be a great item sink if a new end game fire-weak boss were added to the game. I'm of the opinion that it's only a matter of time before Jagex does this anyway.

**Botting mitigation**

Even if new item sinks were introduced, splinters would struggle to hold value and corrode player profits as long as early wave botting exists and is viable.

The quantity of splinters awarded from Colosseum waves 1 - 4 needs to be reduced. This would force bots to risk more valuable gear in order to clear wave 5 or 6 and beyond.

Encounters that can be farmed with extreme budget gear are the most over-botted areas in the game.

- Yama bots - Staff of the dead + Blue moon
- Doom bots - Scobow + Void
- Colo bots - Dragon dagger + Magic shortbow

The more time and capital that bots have to risk to get the same reward as a player, the fewer bots there will be (assuming that bots actually get banned regularly of course). Forcing bots to invest in more expensive gear is an approach that WORKS and will force clankers out of high level PVM.

When the Varlamore diary drops, consider locking the Colosseum behind the medium diary. While this can annoying for some players, its an approach that is demonstrably effective as we've seen with the wilderness bosses.

**The end**

Thanks for reading my post and remember to use the North-West pillar.
