    These bolts have a 6% chance to activate Sunflare cinders which inflicts the target with a very powerful burn dealing 9 damage every 4 ticks for 40 ticks (24 seconds), equating to 90 total burn damage.

    In PvP the activation chance is increased to 10%, the burn damage is reduced to 4 damage every 4 ticks, and the duration is reduced to 20 ticks (12 seconds), equating to 20 total burn damage.

The Western Provinces Hard diary increases the proc chance to 6.6% (11% against players).

The Zaryte Crossbow extends the burn duration to deal one extra instance of damage (99 up from 90).

**Ruby bolt comparison:**

Ruby bolts (e) are exceptionally powerful against high defence, high HP enemies due to the fact that the special effect activates independently of your accuracy roll and completely replaces your normal attack, meaning they provide very high value even with no ranged strength boosting gear.

The Sunfire bolts special effect deals damage in addition to your regular ranged attack, and can't activate if you miss. This makes Sunfire bolts worse than Ruby bolts (e) against high defence & worse ranged gear, but scale to be slightly better than Ruby bolts (e) against low defence and with end game ranged gear.
