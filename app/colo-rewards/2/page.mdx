    These bolts have a 6% chance to activate **Sunflare cinders** which inflicts the target with a very powerful burn dealing 9 damage every 4 ticks for 40 ticks (24 seconds), equating to 90 total burn damage.

    In PvP the activation chance is increased to 10%, the burn damage is reduced to 4 damage every 4 ticks, and the duration is reduced to 20 ticks (12 seconds), equating to 20 total burn damage.

The Kandarin Hard diary increases the proc chance to 6.6% (11% against players).

The Zaryte Crossbow extends the burn duration to deal one extra instance of damage (99 up from 90).

**Ruby bolt comparison:**

The Ruby bolts (e) special effect activates independently of your accuracy roll and completely replaces your normal attack. The Sunfire bolt special effect activates only on a successful hit and works in addition to your normal attack. This makes Sunfire bolts more reliant on ranged strength and accuracy compared to Ruby bolts (e).

Ruby bolts (e) will remain preferable with early or mid-game gear or high defence monsters, being overtaken by Sunfire bolts with end-game setups on lower defence monsters.
