## New use for Echo crystals

This item needs a new thematic gear tie-in.

**Suggestion: Amulet of Echo fury**

<Row>
Like the Amulet of blood fury, combining the crystal with an Amulet of fury creates the amulet of Echo fury with 10k charges. This amulet has the same stats as the fury and blood fury.

<Col>

**Concept 1 passive effect:**

- Whenever you take damage you deal 2 damage back to the attacker.
- Whenever you take damage from an attack that you were praying correctly against, you will also heal 2 hitpoints and lose 1 prayer point.

</Col>

</Row>

This amulet would fill a similar niche to the blood fury and is best used on fights with chip damage. Since its benefit is not directly tied to a melee attack, this amulet is a more versatile option than a blood fury and could function as an answer to high chip damage encounters for range and mage combat.

<Col>

**Concept 2 passive effect:**

- After correctly praying against 5 attacks (10 against players), you automatically cast Minor Vengeance on yourself.
- Minor Vengeance rebounds 40% of the damage taken in the next hit back to the attacker.
- Minor Vengeance stacks with the Lunar spell book Vengeance and Vengeance Other spells.

</Col>

</Row>

This version of the amulet abandons sustain and leans into sacrificing hitpoints for dps rewarding skilled play. This would be great in places where Venge tech is common such as ToB, and would be insane in Tribrid PvP.
