### New use for Echo crystals

<Row>
This item needs a new thematic gear tie-in.

Honestly this one is very hard to solve because the majority of bosses and PVM content have total recoil immunity, so a purely recoil-based solution for this item feels a bit redundant.

**Suggestion: Amulet of Echo fury**

  <Col>
Like the Amulet of blood fury, combining the crystal with an Amulet of fury creates the amulet of Echo fury with 10k charges. This amulet has the same stats as the fury and blood fury.

Passive effect: Whenever you take damage you deal 2 damage back to the attacker. Whenever you take damage from an attack that you were praying correctly against, you will also heal 2hp and lose 1 prayer point.

This amulet would fill a similar niche to the blood fury and is best used on fights with chip damage. Since its benefit is not directly tied to a melee attack, this amulet is a more versatile option than a blood fury and could function as an answer to high chip damage encounters for range and mage combat.
